# NLP-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
In this project from coursera, we train a Naive Bayes classifier to predict sentiment from thousands of Twitter tweets. This project could be practically used by any company with social media presence to automatically predict customer's sentiment (i.e.: whether their customers are happy or not). The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of tweets and customer reviews.

## The tasks of this project include:
- Performing exploratory data analysis and plotting word-cloud
- Applying python libraries to import and visualize dataset
- Evaluating the performance of trained Naïve Bayes Classifier model using confusion matrices.
- Training Naïve Bayes classifier models using Scikit-Learn to preform classification
- Understanding the difference between prior probability, posterior probability and likelihood.
- Understanding the theory and intuition behind Naïve Bayes classifiers
- Performing tokenization to tweet text using Scikit Learn
- Understanding the concept of count vectorization (tokenization)
- Performing text data cleaning such as removing punctuation and stop words

The Untitled.ipynb file contains the Jupyter Notebook that performs the tasks mentioned above. The dataset is stored in amazon_reviews.csv.
